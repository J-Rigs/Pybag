Pybag


Introduction
============

Pybag combines MS DebugEngine bindings with additional helper functions for a
powerful Windows debugging module.


Install
=======

Microsoft debugging tools must already be installed.  Paths might need to be
adjusted in __init__.py and setup.py

    
    python setup.py install
